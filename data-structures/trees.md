# Trees

Composed by nodes which are separeted by:
* A Root: Every tree has only one root, it is the first node in the tree;
* Child: Intermediated level nodes, has one parent and none, many children;
* Leaf: Child when it has no children;

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree which a node has none, one or two children. No all trees has maximum up to 2 nodes.

## Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a binary tree which every node fits this specific ordering property:
* Less then N goes to left;
* Bigger then N goes to right;
This rule should be true for all nodes.
Some tree could accept duplicated values, and normaly this one follow the Less rule.
